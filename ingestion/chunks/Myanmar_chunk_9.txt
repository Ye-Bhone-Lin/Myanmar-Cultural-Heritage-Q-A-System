Myanmar's bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014.[127] General elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled[128]). The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency.[128][129] The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016,[130] and on 15 March 2016, Htin Kyaw was elected as the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962.[131] On 6 April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the newly created role of state counsellor, a role akin to a prime minister.[132] In Myanmar's 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties – particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).[133] Suu Kyi's NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide.[133][134][135] The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a "humiliating" defeat[136][137] – even worse than in 2015[137] – capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats.[135][136] As the election results began emerging, the USDP rejected them, urging a new election with the military as observers.[133][137] More than 90 other smaller parties contested the vote, including more than 15 who complained of irregularities. However, election observers declared there were no major irregularities.[136][135][138] However, despite the election commission validating the NLD's overwhelming victory,[138] the USDP and Myanmar's military persistently alleged fraud.[139][140][141][142][143][excessive citations] In January 2021, just before the new parliament was to be sworn in, the NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming government. [144] In the early morning of 1 February 2021, the day parliament was set to convene, the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military, detained Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party.[136][23][145] The military handed power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and declared a state of emergency for one year[146][23] and began closing the borders, restricting travel and electronic communications nationwide.[145] The military announced it would replace the existing election commission with a new one, and a military media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year – though the military avoided making an official commitment to that.[145] The military expelled NLD party Members of Parliament from the capital city, Naypyidaw.[145] By 15 March 2021 the military leadership continued to extend martial law into more parts of Yangon, while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of violence.[147] By the second day of the coup, thousands of protesters were marching in the streets of Yangon, and other protests erupted nationwide, largely halting commerce and transportation. Despite the military's arrests and killings of protesters, the first weeks of the coup found growing public participation, including groups of civil servants, teachers, students, workers, monks and religious leaders –
