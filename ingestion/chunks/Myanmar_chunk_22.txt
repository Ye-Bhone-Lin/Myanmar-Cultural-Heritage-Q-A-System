Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic, and Indo-European.[294] Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien). The primary Tai–Kadai language is Shan. Mon, Palaung, and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English.[310] More than a hundred languages are spoken in total. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations. Burmese, the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to Tibetan and Chinese.[310] It is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the Mon script, which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write Pali, the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language.[311] Many religions are practised in Myanmar. Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years. The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country.[312] Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years.[313][314][315] More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution.[316][317] A large majority of the population practices Buddhism; estimates range from 80%[318] to 89%.[319][320] According to the 2014 Myanmar Census, 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists.[321] Theravāda Buddhism is the most widespread.[319] There are some 500,000 Buddhist monks and 75,000 nuns in this country of 54 million.[322] Other religions are practised largely without obstruction, with the notable exception of some religious minorities such as the Rohingya people, who have continued to have their citizenship status denied and treated as illegal immigrants instead,[323] and Christians in Chin State.[324] According to 2014 census, 6.2% of the population identifies as Christian; 4.3% as Muslim; 0.8% as followers of tribal religions; 0.5% as Hindus; 0.2% as followers of other religions; and 0.1% follow no religion.[321] According to the 2010 estimates of the Pew Research Center, 7% of the population is Christian; 4% is Muslim; 1% follows traditional animistic beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and East Asian religions.[324][297] Jehovah's Witnesses have been present since 1914[325] and have about 80 congregations around the country and a branch office in Yangon publishing in 16 languages.[326] A tiny Jewish community in Yangon had a synagogue but no resident rabbi.[327] Although Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population, it was a major religion in Myanmar's past.[328][329] Burmese folk religion is practised by
