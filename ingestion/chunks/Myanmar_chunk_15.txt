South Africa also voted against the resolution.[211] There is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962â€“2010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes.[212][213] In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama's Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog that "Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children."[111] Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar.
