produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It). After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element. In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.[360] Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget direct-to-video films. Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies.[361] In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced.[362] Myanmar is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled Chroniques Birmanes by Québécois author and animator, Guy Delisle. The graphic novel was translated into English under the title Burma Chronicles in 2008. In 2009, a documentary about Burmese videojournalists called Burma VJ was released.[363] This film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2010 Academy Awards.[364] The Lady had its world premiere on 12 September 2011 at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival.[365] Government General information 22°N 96°E﻿ / ﻿22°N 96°E﻿ / 22; 96﻿ (Myanmar (Burma))
