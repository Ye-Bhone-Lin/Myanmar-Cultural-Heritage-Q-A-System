the State Department's website lists the country as Burma (Myanmar).[39] The United Nations uses Myanmar, as does the ASEAN and as do Australia,[40] Russia, Germany,[41] China, India, Bangladesh, Norway,[42] Japan,[43] Switzerland,[44] Canada[45] and Ukraine.[46] Most English-speaking international news media refer to the country by the name Myanmar, including the BBC,[47] CNN,[48] Al Jazeera,[49] Reuters,[50] and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)/Radio Australia.[51] Myanmar is known by a name deriving from Burma in Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and Greek.[52] French-language media consistently use Birmanie.[53][54] There are at least nine different pronunciations of the English name Myanmar, and no single one is standard. Pronunciations with two syllables are found most often in major British and American dictionaries.[pronunciations 1] Dictionaries—such as Collins—and other sources also report pronunciations with three syllables.[pronunciations 2][55] As John Wells explains, the English spellings of both Myanmar and Burma assume a non-rhotic variety of English, in which the letter r before a consonant or finally serves merely to indicate a long vowel: [ˈmjænmɑː, ˈbɜːmə]. So the pronunciation of the last syllable of Myanmar as [mɑːr] by some speakers in the UK and most speakers in North America is in fact a spelling pronunciation based on a misunderstanding of non-rhotic spelling conventions. However, Burma is pronounced [ˈbɜːrmə] by rhotic speakers of English due to a phonotactic constraint, as /ɜː/ occurs only before /r/ in those accents.[citation needed] Archaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago.[56] The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar.[57] Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves.[58] The Bronze Age arrived c. 1500 BCE when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so.[59] Human remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in Monywa District in the Sagaing Region.[60] The Iron Age began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day Mandalay.[61] Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE and 200 CE.[62] Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences from outside sources such as India and Thailand, as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places, possibly through trade.[63] Around the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan.[64] The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with
